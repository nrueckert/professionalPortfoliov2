#ProfessionalPortfoliov2

## Description

This project is a basic resume webpage for myself, it's v2 because the first time I was gonna try to copy the example one but realized I was in over my head.

My motivation was to learn how to use flexboxs to position stuff how I want it.

I built this project to have a basic resume for employers to view.

I learned how to manipulate content to where I want it to be displayed.
